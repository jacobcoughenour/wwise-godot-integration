Welcome! This repository provides an integration of [Audiokinetic's Wwise audio middleware](https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/) into the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org). At the moment, Wwise version 2019.2.1.7250 is supported.


## Features

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PrMMagV.png" width="50%">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO42WLEnC18) 

* Wwise wrapper libraries that can be used in games and apps for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. These are provided as [GDNative modules](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/index.html).
* Integration app to ease the process of integrating Wwise into Godot projects.
* Multi-platform build with Scons for the Wwise and Wwise authoring API (Waapi) wrappers. Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 solutions are provided to build on Windows.
* Wwise and Waapi wrappers unit tests with [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut).
* Wwise and Waapi testbed projects.
* Wwise profiler connection enabled in debug builds of the GDNative wrapper.
* Stream manager uses the default blocking I/O implementation and it can be extended to use custom I/O devices.
* Custom Godot nodes: AkEvent, AkEvent2D, AkBank, AkListener, AkListener2D, AkState, AkSwitch, AkEnvironment, AkGeometry, AkRoom, AkPortal, AkEarlyReflections.
* Custom Godot Visual Script nodes: AkLoadBank, AkUnloadBank, AkPostEvent, AkPostEvent2D, AkSet3DPosition, AkSet2DPosition, AkSetState, AkSetSwitch, AkGetRTPCValue, AkSetRTPCValue.
* Custom Godot signals that can be mapped to event callbacks: end of event, audio marker, music sync beat etc.
* Wwise IDs converter from C++ to GDScript code in the Godot editor as addon.
* Waapi picker that allows querying and searching the Wwise project and generating soundbanks from Godot's editor.
* Wwise settings configurable per-platform in the Godot editor.
